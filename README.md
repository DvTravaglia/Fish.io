# Fish.io
Fish.io game

This game was a first game made by Davi Travaglia, it was a final project for Codecademy Computer Science Path, the objective of the game is to eat other fishes and achieve 300Kg
while escaping from sharks and avoiding Skeletons, if you get hit by a shark you lose the game, if you eat a Skeleton you lose 10kg.

The game is in alpha edition, since I want to add Multiplayer, menu, settings (resolution, for example), sounds, and saving HIGHEST SCORE.

You can feel free to use this code if you willing to, and if you want to help me achieve my goals on this project we can talk to each other. :)

Thanks for your attention.
